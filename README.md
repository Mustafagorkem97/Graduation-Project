# Graduation-Project

For my graduation project, I developed an autonomous robot equipped with advanced object recognition capabilities using Arduino R3 Uno and Raspberry Pi 4. The primary objective was to create a self-navigating system capable of identifying and interacting with various objects within its environment.

1- Autonomous Navigation: The robot's movement is controlled by an Arduino R3 Uno, which uses an ultrasonic distance sensor to navigate through complex environments without human intervention. This sensor enables the robot to detect and avoid obstacles dynamically.

2- Object Recognition: A Raspberry Pi 4 is utilized for object recognition, leveraging state-of-the-art computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms. This setup enables the robot to accurately identify objects.
